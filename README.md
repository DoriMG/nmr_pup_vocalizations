# Preprocessing
- Make sure all files are named in the following way: '[colony]\_[recording\_date]\_[animal\_id]\_[file_number]
- Wav files and corresponding text files should have the same name
- Run util/extract_spectrograms to extract individual wav files and spectrograms for each call, and obtain a csv file with animal colony, id, and age for each call
